Wall Crack Detection using Detecto Package
Detecto is a Python package for creating fully functional computer vision and object detection models.
For this work, I did the image annotation using LabelImg and then create a folder containing images labelled "cracked" and "uncracked."
The final prediction is obtained by using a pre-trained model. Finally model gave the pritty much amazing prediction.
